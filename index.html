        <h2 class="history-title" style="color: #121F45;">Max Verstappen: A Chronicle of a Formula 1 Phenomenon</h2>
        <p class="history-text"><span style="color: #223971;"> Verstappen, son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, was
            destined for racing, beginning
            his karting career at age four. He demonstrated prodigious talent, winning numerous championships before
            moving
            to single-seaters. He spent just one year in Formula 3 before making his audacious leap into Formula
            1.</span>
          <br><br><br><br>
          <span style="color: #CC1E4A;">In 2015, he shattered records by debuting for Scuderia Toro Rosso at just 17
            years
            old, becoming the youngest
            driver in the sport's history. His aggressive driving style and raw speed quickly turned heads. A
            sensational
            mid-season promotion to the senior Red Bull Racing team in 2016 saw him win his very first race for the
            squad
            at
            the Spanish Grand Prix, another record for the youngest-ever race winner.</span>
          <br><br><br><br>
          <span style="color: #223971;">After several years of honing his craft and securing consistent victories,
            Verstappen emerged as a
            formidable title contender. In 2021, he engaged in a fierce, season-long battle with seven-time champion
            Lewis
            Hamilton. The rivalry was one of the most intense in F1 history, culminating in a dramatic and controversial
            final-lap overtake at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where Verstappen secured his maiden World
            Championship.</span>
          <br><br><br><br>
          <span style="color: #CC1E4A;">This victory marked the beginning of a new era of dominance. With Red Bull
            Racing
            mastering the new technical
            regulations, Verstappen went on to win consecutive championships in the following years with commanding
            performances. He has since broken numerous records, including the most wins in a single season, cementing
            his
            legacy as one of the all-time greats of Formula 1.</span>
